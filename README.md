Master Thesis at TUM

In this project Post-Nonlinear (PNL) Gaussian causal models have been explored and computational fast algorithms developed.
Pairwise rank likelihood method have been used to estimate the parameters of the Linear Transformation Model, which is
used to estimate the causal order of PNL models consistently.
